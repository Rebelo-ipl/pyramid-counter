# Minecraft Pyramid Limit Plugin

The Minecraft Pyramid Limit plugin is designed to enforce specific limitations on player interactions within a designated pyramid area in the game. It serves as a mini-game script to control player actions and ensure fair gameplay.

## Features

- **Daily Run Limit**: Players are restricted from running the pyramid mini-game more than a specified number of times per day.
- **Daily Item Limit**: Players can only pick up a limited number of items from the pyramid mini-game area each day.
- **Boundary Checking**: The plugin ensures that player interactions occur within the defined boundaries of the pyramid area.
- **Automatic Reset**: Limits reset automatically at midnight, allowing players to engage in the mini-game again.

## Installation

1. Copy the JAR file generated by building the plugin to the `plugins` directory of your Bukkit server.
2. Restart the Bukkit server to load the plugin.

## Configuration

- Customize the boundaries of the pyramid area by adjusting the coordinates in the plugin code.
- Modify the maximum daily run and item limits as needed.

## Usage

Players interact with the pyramid mini-game area by approaching the designated boundaries and interacting with chests or other interactive elements within the area. The plugin enforces the specified limitations on player actions to maintain balance and fairness in the mini-game.

## Dependencies

- [Bukkit API](https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Bukkit_API): The plugin relies on the Bukkit API to interact with the Minecraft server environment.
